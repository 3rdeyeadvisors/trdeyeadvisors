# 3rdEyeAdvisors Development Standards

## Purpose
This document establishes the systematic workflow for all feature development and bug fixes to ensure:
- Zero regressions or unexpected side effects
- Complete mobile-first responsive design
- Full backend integration before frontend implementation
- Comprehensive testing before marking complete
- Reduced credit waste through proactive planning

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Implementation Planning Checklist

**BEFORE writing ANY code, document the following:**

### 1. Frontend Requirements

- [ ] State management needs
- [ ] API calls needed
- [ ] Loading states required
- [ ] Error states required
- [ ] Empty states required

### 2. Backend Requirements
- [ ] Database tables/columns needed
- [ ] RLS policies required (Who can read? Who can write?)
- [ ] Edge functions needed

## Phase 2: Phased Implementation

### Step 1: Backend First (Always!)

**Order of operations:**
1. Create database schema with migrations
2. Add RLS policies (test with different user roles)
3. Create edge functions
4. Add proper logging to edge functions
5. Test edge functions with curl/function tester
6. Document endpoints and expected responses

**Verification before proceeding:**
- [ ] Database tables created successfully

- [ ] Edge functions deploy without errors
- [ ] Edge functions tested and working
- [ ] All secrets/env vars configured

### Step 2: Frontend Desktop

**Order of operations:**
1. Build UI components (use design system tokens)
2. Integrate with backend APIs
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Add loading states
5. Add empty states
6. Test all scenarios on desktop

**Verification before proceeding:**
- [ ] UI matches design system
- [ ] All API calls work correctly
- [ ] Error handling displays properly
- [ ] Loading states show correctly

3. Fix any layout issues
4. Verify navigation works

**Verification before proceeding:**
- [ ] Works perfectly at 768px
- [ ] Works perfectly at 1024px
- [ ] Layout adapts appropriately

### Step 5: Edge Cases & Polish

**Order of operations:**
1. Test with no data
2. Test with errors
3. Test permission failures
4. Test with different user roles
5. Test rapid user interactions
6. Add analytics/logging if needed

**Verification before proceeding:**
- [ ] No data state works
- [ ] Error states work
- [ ] Permission failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Different user roles work correctly
- [ ] Rapid clicks don't cause issues
- [ ] Analytics/logging in place

- What could break if changed (dependencies, side effects)
- Related components/functions (what else might be affected)

### Known Limitations
- What doesn't work yet
- What's out of scope
- Performance limitations
- Browser/device limitations

### Future Considerations
- What could be improved
- What should be added later
- What should be refactored
- What should be deprecated

## Emergency Response Protocol

**If a critical bug is discovered in production:**

1. **Assess Impact**
   - How many users affected?
   - Is data at risk?
   - Is revenue impacted?

2. **Immediate Mitigation**
   - Can we roll back to previous version?
   - Can we disable the feature temporarily?
   - Can we apply a hotfix?

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - What broke?
   - Why did our testing miss it?
   - How can we prevent this in the future?

4. **Post-Mortem**
   - Document what happened
   - Update standards to prevent recurrence
   - Update test cases
   - Update checklists

---

## Development Principles

### 1. Mobile-First Always
Every feature must work perfectly on mobile BEFORE being marked complete.

### 2. Backend Before Frontend
Database, RLS, and edge functions must be complete and tested before building UI.

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
Start with core functionality, then add polish and enhancements.

### 4. Fail Gracefully
Every error must be handled and displayed to the user appropriately.

### 5. Test Everything
If it's not tested, it's broken.

### 6. Document Everything
If it's not documented, it will be forgotten.

### 7. Security First
Always assume malicious users. Validate everything. Trust nothing.

### 8. Performance Matters
Slow is broken. Optimize for speed.

### 9. Accessibility is Required
Everyone should be able to use our platform.

### 10. Data Integrity is Sacred
User data must never be lost, corrupted, or exposed.

## Credit Efficiency Strategy

### How This Saves Credits

**Before (Reactive):**
```
Request → Quick Fix → Breaks Mobile → Fix Mobile → Breaks Backend → 
Fix Backend → Creates New Bug → Fix Bug → [10-15 messages wasted]
```

**After (Proactive):**
```
Request → Plan (frontend+backend+mobile) → Implement Systematically → 
Verify Checklist → Done [2-4 messages total]
```

### Key Principles:
1. **Plan holistically** - Consider all aspects before coding
2. **Implement systematically** - Backend first, then frontend, then mobile
3. **Verify comprehensively** - Use checklist to catch issues before they become problems
4. **Document thoroughly** - Prevent re-learning the same lessons

### When to Use Credits:
- ✅ Planning new features (worth it)
- ✅ Implementing features correctly the first time (worth it)
- ✅ Proactive audits to catch issues early (worth it)
- ❌ Fixing regressions from rushed implementations (waste)
- ❌ Discovering issues the hard way (waste)
- ❌ Band-aid fixes that create new problems (waste)
